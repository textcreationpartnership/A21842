            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And at the same time also, her Maiesties pleasure was declared in her said Starrechamber, by the Lord Chancellor of England (as so commanded by her Maiestie) that all the Iustices of Assises of the Realme, who were then there present, shoulde in their next Circuite through her whole Realme giue knowledge thereof in their open Sessions, &amp; to charge all Iustices of peace, that in their quarter Sessions, and in any other their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, and also all Maiors, and Officers of Townes Corporate, &amp; all Officers of Liberties in their Courts, should see to the speedy execution thereof, after conuenient time to be limitted for a reasonable warning, by the said Iustices of Assise, for the due execution and punishment of the offenders, so as no subiect of the Realme shal haue cause by ignorance to continue in their offence. The like commandement also was there in that assemblie giuen by the said Lord Chancelor to all the Heads, Auncients &amp; Principals of houses of Court and Chancerie, where the aforesaide excesse was noted to be more largely of late yeeres spread amongst the youth there, then in any other place of England, to see also to the speedie reformation thereof. The like commaundement also was there remembred to haue bene of late giuen by her Maiesties owne mouth to the Maior of London, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen of the same, being before her Maiestie in her Presence chamber at her Court. So as it may wel appeare how earnestly her Maiestie is resolued to haue this notable disorder and excesse speedily &amp; earnestly reformed for the benefit of her Realme. At the same assembly also was concluded y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in the two Vniuersities of Cambridge and Oxford, where this infection was seene to haue made entrie amongst the youth, there should be by the direction of the Lords the Chancelours of the same, a streight order for repressing of the said disordered excesse of Apparell. And though her Maiestie might by iustice of her lawes, make great profite by the execution of the same lawes remaining in force against the said excesse, by leuying the great penalties due to her by execution of the same, and that also some part of the same lawes, being made diuers yeeres past, by the alteration of time, may see me in some part hard to be exactly and duely obserued in all parts: Therefore hir Maiesties meaning was there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared at this time to be to make some proofe of the execution onely of some parts of the same lawes, agreeable to the time heereafter expressed, without charging her subiects with the great forfeitures alreadie due to her Maiestie, except it shall be against such persons as she shall be prouoked finding them disobedient and vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to obey and obserue the speciall clauses and articles hereafter following.</p>
